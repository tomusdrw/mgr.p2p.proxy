* Thu Jan 31 2008 Francois Aucamp <faucamp@csir.co.za> - 0.0.svn150
- Preparing for initial 0.1 release
- Thanks to Haiyang Ma for providing a patch for the KademliaProtocol class,
  fixing an issue with UDP datagram transmission delays
- This snapshot is functional, although some package restructuring and API
  breakage might occur in the course of the 0.1 - 0.3 release timeframe
- Implemented features:
  - Kademlia DHT implementation, with 3 different routing table implementations
  - 2 example data storage ("datastore") implementations
  - basic UDP-based RPC protocol; used for network organisation, but may be
    used for other things as well (e.g. file transfer). No NAT traversal yet.
  - "DELETE" RPC allowing removal of key/value pairs from the DHT
  - Keyword-based higher level search/store procedures using inverted indexes
    (for keyword searching)
  - De-centralized, distributed tuple space, supporting the following Linda
    concepts:
    - "in"  ("get" in Entangled)
    - "rd"  ("read" in Entangled)
    - "out" ("put" in Entangled)
- Added example scripts: create_network.py, fileshare.py, gui.py
- Added unittests
